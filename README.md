## Tara Sankhalpara

Graduated from university in 2017 and began a role in Payments, for a Fintech company. This is where I began to learn more about the tech industry and had a passion to develop my knowledge. Following this I decided to leave my job and attend Makers coding bootcamp. Since then I have continued to learn and grow, focusing on a career in tech and each day becoming a better developer than I was yesterday.
